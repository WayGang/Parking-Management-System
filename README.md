# Parking-Management-System
This is to build a system that can self detect the car plates and calculate the parking fee. We have realised the function to capture the license plate from a car photo. Our next step is to use google vision to recongnise the charcters on the license plates. 

## First install the required library

    pip install -r requirements.txt 

## Second run lpr.py program
    python lpr.py
